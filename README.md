## Story
You are Gregg!  You've been coding for the Ludum Dare for around 30 hours and it is now 3:00 AM Sunday Morning.  Things are going well until suddenly you're power goes out.  You are in a frenzy to try to fix it, and when all appears to be hopeless, you remember that you're electrician friend is just on the other side of town!  You embark on your quest in your sleepy haze.  However, from all these restless hours of coding, your body has started to shut down on you and try to make you sleep.  In order to make it across town, you must take periodic naps to maintain your will to go on (your willpower).  Lastly, due to how little sleep you've gotten, you have started to hallucinate and become paranoid.  Weird walls start to show up along your path to your friends house, and an odd figure appears to be following you.

## Gameplay
Make it to The End without being caught by the hallucination following you.  
You must sleep in order to maintain your willpower, which allows you to move.
When resting you cannot move.
Rest in designated rest spaces to sleep faster and more efficiently.
Be strategic, Don't get caught, and make it to the end!
